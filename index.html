    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a hardworking and determined working student who consistently balances academic responsibilities with professional commitments. Despite the challenges of managing both work and studies, I remain focused, disciplined, and resilient in pursuing my goals. I am driven by my dream to someday work abroad, expand my experiences, and gain global exposure that will help shape a better future for myself and my family. <br>

        <br>This dream is the reason I chose to pursue a degree in Information Technology—a field that offers endless opportunities for innovation, growth, and international careers. Through continuous learning, perseverance, and a strong work ethic, I strive to develop both my technical skills and personal character. I believe that every challenge I face today is a stepping stone toward success, and that through patience, sacrifice, and determination, I can turn my aspirations into reality and become a globally competitive IT professional.

  <p>
  Life isn’t just about textbooks, exams, and deadlines. For me, some of the best moments happen beyond academics, especially when I hit the open road. I’ve always been drawn to the sense of freedom that comes with a road trip—the wind in my hair, the changing scenery, and the thrill of discovering new places. <br>

  <br> I don’t always need company to enjoy it. Sometimes, it’s just me, my favorite music, and the road ahead. Other times, I love sharing the adventure with friends, laughing at inside jokes, and making memories together. Road trips allow me to recharge, reflect, and see life from a different perspective, away from the pressures of schoolwork. <br>

  <br> I’m exploring a nearby town or venturing farther, the journey itself is as exciting as the destination. It teaches me patience, planning, and spontaneity—all valuable lessons that go beyond the classroom. For me, road trips are not just a hobby; they are a way to celebrate life, freedom, and the joy of adventure.
